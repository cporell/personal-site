            <h3>Long story short</h3> 
            The World of Aotis is an ongoing project of mine, as I piece together
            a fictional world starting from its inception up through its "present day," analogous to a more
            fantastic version of a circa-2010s soiety. As such, Aotis' history ranges from prehistoric, 
            to medieval, to contemporary.

            To learn more about it, I've compiled a 
            <a href="https://aotis.wikia.com/wiki/World_of_Aotis_Wiki">Wikia</a> all about it.
            This is a continously ongoing project, so the wiki is always growing, changing, and being updated,
            so please forgive any incomplete, missing, or incorrect pages.

            <h3>Inception</h3>
            Creating the fictional world of Aotis has been a side project of mine only in recent memory, though the
            earliest inklings of the project stretch back nearly 10 years.

            I've had an interest in telling stories for most of my life. From my earliest experiences,
            I would put little stories into notebooks, either through written word or just through pictures.
            For most of my life, these were fairly disjoint little ventures, often a one-off vignette I thought
            of or a small continuation of an existing work. These little episodes, by themselves, never
            had much structure, but I always got joy out of interconnecting stories.

            When I was in late high school, the first seeds of this project began in earnest. Though it did not
            resemble anything close to what it is nowadays, parts of Aotis

            It wasn't until a few years ago, when I read George R.R. Martin's <i>A Song of Ice and Fire</i> and 
            discovered the Reddit commmunities /r/writing and /r/worldbuilding that I knew what this interest in
            creating a fictional society was
