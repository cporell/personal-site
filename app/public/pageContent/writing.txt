		"descriptionShort": "A breakdown of 'Good' vs. 'Bad' difficulty in games",
		"descriptionLong": "Near the end of my senior year at WPI, I gave an informal talk at a weekly meeting of their Game Developers' Association, going over examples of what I considered to be well- or poorly-implemented difficulty measures in various games, and how, as game developers, we can learn from those examples when toning the difficulty curve of our own games. The slides are original; however, the audio has been re-recorded, as the original has been lost."
