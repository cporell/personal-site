					Connor Porell is a web app developer, amateur game developer, and budding dungeonmaster. Their interest
					in games and computers led them to enroll in a double major in Computer Science and Interactive Media at
					Worcester Polytechnic Institute, where they graduated in 2016. They now use their skills at The MITRE
					Corporation, where they develop and maintain Sharepoint apps and Node apps for the company.

                    In their free time, Connor enjoys gaming and worldbuilding, particulary for Pathfinder campaigns, but mostly
                    for the pure escapism. Their interest in worldbuilding stems back to high school, where the first inklings of their
                    current projects started as fan-made world concepts for one of their favorite games until over time it evolved into
                    a more original concept.

                    Though they tend to keep to themselves about such issues, Connor is also a staunch advocate for embracing yourself
                    regardless of social conventions.
